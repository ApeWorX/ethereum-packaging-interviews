# Insights from Tenderly and EIP-2678

## Introduction
Ethereum Improvement Proposal 2678 (EIP-2678) is a significant step towards standardizing the data format for Ethereum smart contract packages. This proposal is crucial for the Ethereum development ecosystem, aiming to streamline the process of recreating compilations, including source and output artifacts. Tenderly, a platform that provides developer tools for smart contract monitoring and testing, has provided valuable insights into the challenges and potential improvements in line with EIP-2678.

## Understanding EIP-2678
EIP-2678 seeks to define a data format for package manifest documents, which would include all necessary information to recreate the compilation of smart contracts. This standardization would allow for interoperability across different development tools, frameworks, and infrastructure.

## Challenges with Current Practices
Tenderly experiences difficulties in fetching contract data due to the lack of a standardized API, leading to inconsistent error diagnosis and verification issues. The absence of standardized error messages further complicates the process, especially when using verification tools like Etherscan and Blockscout.

## Proposed Solutions and Improvements
- Implementing a standard open-source URI for accessing contract data could simplify the verification process for platforms like Etherscan and Tenderly.
- Developing scripts to generate Solidity manifests and parse common groups of data would help standardize the verification process.
- Managing changes and versions through best practices could improve the reliability of verification procedures.

## Infrastructure and API Integration
Tenderly's API verifies contracts by comparing bytecode from the network with the build code provided by developers. An internal step called "account service" aids in recompilation, ensuring that the source file and compiler information lead to accurate verification.

## Dependency Management and Recompilation Issues
- Dependency management is handled through UI uploads or callbacks, with the potential for discrepancies in project structure and bytecode handling.
- Recompilation issues can arise from differences in project structures, Vyper functions, and bytecode representations.

## Future Considerations and Extensions
It's important to consider extensions and additional features beyond the standard to accommodate diverse protocols and requirements. Tenderly emphasizes the need for flexibility and adaptability in Ethereum development tools.

## Conclusion
The insights from Tenderly highlight the importance of standardization and collaboration in Ethereum development. EIP-2678 and similar initiatives are crucial for creating a more efficient, reliable, and interoperable ecosystem. As Ethereum evolves, these efforts will be instrumental in supporting developers and fostering innovation.
