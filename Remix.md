EthPM streamline the build information so we dont build the a different tool for  each project to do the same thing across the board.



Questions:
Dev tool questions:
Files are legacy and saving abis and bitcode
When user compile and pulling files from repo and before source and 

2 way of storing artifacts: 
* customs ways of importing files
* passing the import and managing request to get files too#apis 
* the import file is an ipfs hash, a raw url, github url with branch names

also by defaul the compiler is looking athe NPM package 

By default looking at NPM upkn
Swampt too
Apfs
We can also allow remapping 

How do you manage your build process



What are some problems with the current process and like with dependencies
Have the standard
Loading compilers, not really an issue anymore 
Overwriting the hardhat ____ 
Standard ways to linking compilation  maybe interesting
When you want to swap and switch frameworks
Overriding data objects when swapping

Hash of the data, hardhat store them in metadata files it was not consistent

Flag in soliditiy compiler is hash of the data is going to be in consistent, 
If the compilation fails, 

If the deeper analysis be include in the separate file to keep it orgranized 
Fetch import node and targets and configs in high level and parsing to loook for these setting to mange import


	How does your framework manage solidity compilation
How do you store it
What the structure of the folder
How do you manage dependencies from different frameworks
	How do you add dependencies to your project, config files?
	What ways fetching project dependencies do you support, github local file tree

What are some problems with the current process:
When you try to compile some import with different pragma you always have to switch

Web3.js 
do you mange the data in a specifi way? Not at the moment, when the user deploy contract and mapping the compilation to address, we dont say it at the time, we plan to do save the compilation and abi. Want to plan save it

We should keep in mind that it should be as lightweight

Automated d change log, every time you update the manifest it should keep track of it
To know if it stale, to check the manifest is benefit
To see if there is difference between version compile

Regarding publishing:
Issue: there are a bunch of etherscan websites style and they all want to integrate with remix and too many PRs 
We want to have one standard to work with the ethercan style without too much overhead
We dont know if the API keys standard the same, we all dont play by the same rules

Standard the interface format for the etherscans, 

Long term solution: sorufiy has the right approach, automate the verification
Lets start of with the standard and sample of what everyone sould strive for to make it easier
Representation of the project, to have standard verification

User write the bitcode in the ethereum it is anti spam 

What makes you certain the hash is correct,

Link in the ABIs, make it efficient
	
How do you manage deployments i know you work with sourceify and etherscan

Verifications?




	How do you fetch previous publish contracts type information
	And for testing and internal testing, when you run local testing how do you know that contract type information, is there something cached
	

What are some problems with the current process

How do you publish code after it is deployed
How problems do you have there
How bad etherscan api is, it is inconsistent and hard to use
